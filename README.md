test-data
=========

Use this to prepare multiple JSON files for both video and user info to match QA's test cases/acceptance crits.  initial json files found in test-data/public.  The system basically looks for 'videoInfo1.json' and 'userData1.json' just rename other json files to match those 2 to changes user & video data dynamically.
